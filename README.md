# Multi-View Image Analysis - Scene-Adaptive Feature Correspondence Pipeline

A robust feature correspondence system for multi-view image analysis that employs scene-adaptive processing and integrated quality assessment. Built for the ETH3D dataset, this pipeline significantly improves matching quality and spatial coverage through pose-guided matching strategies and multi-layer occlusion detection.

## Key Features

- **Scene-Adaptive Processing**: Automatically adjusts matching parameters based on scene characteristics
  - Geometric complexity analysis and scene classification (confined/structured/open)
  - Dynamic parameter adjustment for different scene types
  - Quaternion-based view overlap computation

- **GPU-Accelerated Preprocessing**:
  - Optimized color space transformations (RGB→LAB→XYZ)
  - Enhanced CLAHE implementation with bilateral filtering
  - Batch processing with automated reference size detection

- **Advanced Feature Correspondence**:
  - FLANN-based matching with geometric verification
  - Multi-layer occlusion handling using masks and 3D constraints
  - Track formation with quality-based filtering
  - Comprehensive quality metrics and validation

## Performance Highlights

- 28.47% spatial coverage (vs. 25.7% baseline)
- Average track length increased from 3.49 to 3.56 frames
- Consistent quality scores (0.93/1.00)
- Processing over 1 million features with geometric consistency
- 38.52% successful 2D-3D correspondence rate
- Mean triangulation angle: 10.85°

## System Requirements

- The Setup Guide is present in the Setup Document (Environment) folder.
- Note that these commands are not ready-to-use Envrionment Setup Commands but rather are meant to be used for an idea.
- The latest copy of the YML file is present in the respective folder.
- This environment almost took 11+ GB and its requires significant study, and careful installation.
