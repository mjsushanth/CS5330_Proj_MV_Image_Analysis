Yes, there are several commands to manage and monitor your conda environments. Here are the key commands:

1. **List all environments**:
```bash
conda env list
# or
conda info --envs
```

2. **Show size of environments** (Windows PowerShell):
```powershell
# Navigate to your conda directory (usually in your user folder)
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\miniconda3\envs
# List directory sizes
Get-ChildItem | ForEach-Object {
    $size = (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1GB
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $_.Name
        "Size(GB)" = [math]::Round($size, 2)
    }
}
```

3. **List packages in current environment**:
```bash
conda list
```

4. **List packages in specific environment**:
```bash
conda list -n environment_name
```

5. **Remove an environment**:
```bash
conda env remove -n environment_name
```

6. **Clean up unused packages and caches** (frees up disk space):
```bash
conda clean --all
```

7. **View details about current environment**:
```bash
conda info
```

You can also use the Anaconda Navigator if you prefer a GUI:
```bash
# Install Anaconda Navigator
conda install anaconda-navigator

# Launch it
anaconda-navigator
```

To monitor disk space used by conda:

1. **Check package cache size**:
```bash
conda clean -p --dry-run
```

2. **Check downloaded tarballs**:
```bash
conda clean -t --dry-run
```

3. **Check index cache**:
```bash
conda clean -i --dry-run
```

Quick cleanup workflow:
```bash
# List environments
conda env list

# Remove unused environment
conda env remove -n unused_environment

# Clean everything
conda clean --all -y

# Verify disk space recovered (PowerShell)
cd C:\Users\YourUsername\miniconda3
Get-ChildItem | ForEach-Object {
    $size = (Get-ChildItem $_.FullName -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1GB
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $_.Name
        "Size(GB)" = [math]::Round($size, 2)
    }
}
```

Remember:
- `base` is your default environment and shouldn't be removed
- Clean the conda cache periodically using `conda clean --all`
- Keep track of which environments you actually need
- Document the purpose of each environment

Would you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail or provide additional management tips?
